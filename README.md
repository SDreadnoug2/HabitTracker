Welcome to Habit Tracker!

This is my goofy little project while I go through my beginner's computer science course.
I'm using it primarily to keep track of my own goals and streaks.

I'm currently planning on adding a project book to keep track of what I have going on, as well as another randomizer to suggest what to work on next.
I think the main thing looking at it right now is that I should refactor alot of it into classes, particularly check in and running the input, which would clean it up alot.

For now though, here's the manual:

IST OF COMMANDS:
-- Check In -- 
Allows you to update your streaks for the day! Available once per calendar day.

-- Streak Length --
Shows how long your current streak is

-- Define Streak -- 
Allows you to change what streaks your currently tracking. 
Appears like this: For X days, you've (What you're tracking) . <- Note the period

-- Exit --
Closes the program.
